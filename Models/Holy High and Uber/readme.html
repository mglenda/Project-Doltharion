<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Okay here are some little caster attachments I whipped up a while ago. They are based off of the similar wow ones (before you start yelling at me, remind yourself of olof's two dragons), but I made them much better! Now they only use in-game textures and they show up well in-game. You could attach them via triggers, using the &quot;Art - Caster&quot; thing, or whatever!<br />
<br />
Give credits to Pyritie if you use them!<br />
